  // Common questions and responses
  const commonQuestions = {
    "How much could I save with a 1kW solar system?": "For a 1kW system, cleaning can recover up to 15% of lost efficiency due to dirt, salt, and debris, which can save you about $50‚Äì$75 annually. By cleaning your panels, you avoid paying 30c/kWh for grid electricity and reduce reliance on costly energy. If you export energy, the feed-in tariff (6‚Äì9c/kWh) can help you earn additional income.",
    "What could I save with a 2kW solar system?": "With a 2kW system, cleaning could recover 15% of lost efficiency, saving you around $100‚Äì$150 per year. This saves on your electricity bill, which costs about 30c/kWh from the grid. If you export excess energy, you could also make money from the feed-in tariff (6‚Äì9c/kWh).",
    "What‚Äôs the savings potential for a 3kW system?": "For a 3kW system, cleaning could save you approximately $150‚Äì$200 annually by recovering lost efficiency of up to 15%. By reducing your reliance on expensive grid electricity (30c/kWh), you'll save more. If you export energy, you could also make money from the feed-in tariff (6‚Äì9c/kWh).",
    "How much could I save with a 4kW solar system?": "Cleaning your 4kW system can save you around $200‚Äì$250 annually by recovering up to 15% of lost efficiency. Reducing your dependence on grid electricity (30c/kWh) directly lowers your electricity bill. Additionally, the feed-in tariff can provide further savings if you export energy.",
    "What savings can I expect with a 5kW solar system?": "With a 5kW system, cleaning could save you $250‚Äì$325 annually by recovering up to 15‚Äì20% of the lost energy. By avoiding grid electricity charges (30c/kWh) and maximizing your system's output, you save significantly. If you export excess energy, you‚Äôll earn a feed-in tariff of 6‚Äì9c/kWh, further boosting savings.",
    "What can I save with a 6kW solar system?": "A 6kW system can save you around $300‚Äì$375 annually through cleaning, which recovers 15‚Äì20% of lost energy. This helps reduce the need for grid electricity at 30c/kWh. By exporting energy, you may also earn from the feed-in tariff (6‚Äì9c/kWh). Regular cleaning ensures optimal performance of your system.",
    "How much can I save with a 7kW system?": "For a 7kW system, cleaning can save approximately $350‚Äì$450 annually by recovering 15‚Äì20% of lost efficiency. With grid electricity costing 30c/kWh, keeping your panels clean reduces your electricity bill. Additionally, if you export energy, the feed-in tariff can provide extra income.",
    "What‚Äôs the savings for an 8kW solar system after cleaning?": "Cleaning your 8kW system can save you $400‚Äì$500 annually by restoring up to 20% of lost efficiency. This helps reduce the amount of electricity you need to purchase from the grid at 30c/kWh. If you export excess energy, the feed-in tariff can help offset the cost of cleaning and bring in extra money.",
    "How much can I save with a 9kW system on the coast?": "For a 9kW system, cleaning can recover 20% of lost efficiency, which translates to savings of $450‚Äì$550 annually. This reduces the need to buy electricity from the grid at 30c/kWh, which can be quite expensive. Additionally, by exporting energy, you can earn a feed-in tariff of 6‚Äì9c/kWh.",
    "What savings can I expect with a 10kW solar system?": "A 10kW system can save you $500‚Äì$650 annually by recovering 20% of lost energy efficiency. This reduces the amount of grid electricity you need (at 30c/kWh), directly lowering your electricity costs. Additionally, exporting excess energy will earn you the feed-in tariff, adding to your savings.",
    "How much could I save with an 11kW solar system?": "With an 11kW system, cleaning could save you $550‚Äì$700 annually by recovering 20% of lost efficiency. Reducing reliance on grid electricity (30c/kWh) helps you save on energy bills. Additionally, the feed-in tariff can add to your savings if you export excess energy back to the grid.",
    "What could I save with a 12kW solar system?": "For a 12kW system, cleaning could save you $600‚Äì$750 annually by recovering up to 20% of lost energy. By avoiding grid electricity costs (30c/kWh) and maximizing the output of your panels, you‚Äôll reduce your energy expenses. If you export excess energy, you can earn from the feed-in tariff (6‚Äì9c/kWh).",
    "How much can I save with a 13kW solar system?": "Cleaning your 13kW system can save you approximately $650‚Äì$800 annually by recovering 20% of lost energy efficiency. This will reduce your reliance on grid electricity (30c/kWh) and save you money on your energy bill. Exporting excess energy will also provide additional income from the feed-in tariff.",
    "What‚Äôs the savings potential for a 14kW solar system?": "A 14kW system can save you $700‚Äì$875 annually through cleaning, which restores up to 20% of the lost energy. By reducing your need for grid electricity (30c/kWh), you lower your electricity costs significantly. Additionally, the feed-in tariff (6‚Äì9c/kWh) can provide extra savings if you export energy.",
    "How much could I save with a 15kW solar system?": "For a 15kW system, cleaning could save you $750‚Äì$900 annually by recovering 20% of lost efficiency. This will lower your electricity bill by reducing your reliance on the grid (30c/kWh). Additionally, if you export excess energy, you could earn from the feed-in tariff (6‚Äì9c/kWh), increasing your overall savings."
